# Butternut Box - Front End Developer Task
This repo contains the submission of my developer task for a Front End Developer position at Butternut Box.

A online version of this task can also be found at http://butternutbox.jamesbovis.com

## Getting started
To clone this repo, run ```git clone https://github.com/James-Bovis/Butternut-Box-Task.git``` into your terminal.

When the project has been downloaded, move into the folder by typing ```cd Butternut-Box-Task```. Now, once your in the Butternut-Box-Task folder, run ```npm install``` to download the dependencies.

Once finished, running ```gulp``` will fire up a local web-server, compile the SASS and open up a new browser window showing the task. Any changes that are made to the ```index.html```, JS files or any of the SASS files, the browser window will be refreshed automatically.

## Other tasks
```gulp sass``` - This compiles the SASS stylesheets into the CSS folder

```gulp watch``` - This watches all the files and refreshes the browser on change

## Notes
This project uses the excellent JavasScript plugin [wow.js](https://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW/) for animating an element when it is in view. I have used this plugin on other projects and it is super easy to use and works great. Visit the [wow.js repo](https://github.com/matthieua/WOW) for more information about it's use and development.
